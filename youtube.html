<p1>Postgraduate education, graduate education, or graduate school consists of academic or professional degrees, certificates,
diplomas, or other qualifications usually pursued by post-secondary students who have earned an undergraduate
 (bachelor's) degree.The organization and structure of postgraduate education varies in different countries,
 as well as in different institutions within countries.[3] While the term "graduate school" or "grad school"
 is typically used in North America (Canada and the United States), "postgraduate" (or 'post-graduate') is often
used in regions such as Australia, Bangladesh, India, Ireland, much of Latin America, New Zealand, Pakistan,
South Africa, Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia and the United Kingdom.

Graduate degrees can include master's degrees, doctoral degrees, and other qualifications such as graduate diplomas,
 certificates and professional degrees. A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of 
 study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, 
 which can include medical school, law school, business school, and other institutions of specialized fields
  such as nursing, speechâ€“language pathology, engineering, or architecture. The distinction between graduate
   schools and professional schools is not absolute since various professional schools offer graduate degrees and vice versa.
    
Producing original research is a significant component of graduate studies in the humanities, natural sciences
 and social sciences. This research typically leads to the writing and defense of a thesis or dissertation.
  In graduate programs that are oriented toward professional training (e.g., MPA, MBA, JD, MD), the degrees 
  may consist solely of coursework, without an original research or thesis component. Graduate students in 
  the humanities, sciences and social sciences often receive funding from their university (e.g., fellowships
   or scholarships) or a teaching assistant position or other job; in the profession-oriented grad programs,
    students are less likely to get funding, and the fees are typically much higher.
    
    Although graduate school programs are distinct from undergraduate degree programs, graduate instruction 
    (in the US, Australia, and other countries) is often offered by some of the same senior academic staff and
     departments who teach undergraduate courses. Unlike in undergraduate programs, however, it is less common 
     for graduate students to take coursework outside their specific field of study at graduate or graduate entry
      level. At the doctorate programs, though, it is quite common for students to take courses from a wider
       range of study, for which some fixed portion of coursework, sometimes known as a residency, is typically
        required to be taken from outside the department and university of the degree-seeking candidate to broaden
         the research abilities of the student. In East Asia, students pursuing graduate programs are called "research 
         students".</p1>
         <h>TYPES OF POST GRADUATIONS.</h>
         <P>Programmes are divided into coursework-based and research-based degrees. Coursework programs typically include qualifications such as [20]
         
         Graduate certificate, six-month full-time coursework[21]
         Graduate diploma, twelve-month full-time coursework[22]
         Master (of Arts, Science or other discipline). 1 year to 2 years of full-time study for coursework and research master's and 3 to 4 years of full-time study for extended master's degrees (which can allow the use of the word doctor in their title, such as Doctor of Medicine and Juris Doctor). Research master's ends in the submission of a thesis.[23]
         Doctor of Philosophy, 3 to 4 years full-time study. Also ends in the submission of a thesis.[24]
         Higher doctorate, awarded usually ten or more years after the completion of PhD (which is a prerequisite of higher doctorate) after submission of a research portfolio that is of a higher standard than that required for the awarding of a PhD.[25]</P>
